# GaiaNet RAG API Pipeline

`rag-api-pipeline` is a Python-based data pipeline tool that allows you to easily generate a vector knowledge base from any REST API data source. The
resulting database snapshot can then be plugged into a Gaia node's LLM model with a prompt and provide contextual responses to user queries using RAG 
(Retrieval Augmented Generation).

The following sections help you quickly set up and execute the pipeline on your REST API. If you're looking for more in-depth information about how to use 
this tool, the tech stack and/or how it works under the hood, check the content menu on the left.

## System Requirements

- Poetry ([Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))
- Python 3.11.x
- (Optional): a Python virtual environment manager of your preference (e.g. conda, venv)
- Docker and Docker compose
- Qdrant vector database ([Docs](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/))
- LLM model provider (either a Gaianet node or Ollama)

## Setup Instructions

::::steps
### Clone this repository

Git clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash [Terminal]
git clone https://github.com/raid-guild/gaianet-rag-api-pipeline.git
```

### Activate your virtual environment

It is recommended to activate your [own virtual environment](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment); 
otherwise, Poetry will create/use a brand new environment. Check how Poetry [manages environments](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/) for details.

### Install project dependencies

Navigate to the directory where this repository was cloned/downloaded and execute the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash [Terminal]
cd gaianet-rag-api-pipeline
poetry install
```

### Set environment variables

Copy `config/.env/sample` into `config/.env` file and set environment variables accordingly. Check the [environment variables](/getting-started#environment-variables) section below
for details.

### Define your API Pipeline manifest

Now it's time to define the pipeline manifest for the REST API from which you're looking to extract data. Check how to define an API pipeline manifest in 
[Defining an API Pipeline Manifest](/manifest-definition) for details, or take a look at the in-depth review of the sample manifests available in 
[API Examples](/apis).

### Set the REST API Key

The API must require an API key when sending requests. You can set it in the `config/secrets/api_key` file, or specify it using the `--api-key` argument in the CLI.

### Setup a Qdrant DB instance

Get the base URL of your Qdrant Vector DB or deploy a local `Qdrant` ([Docs](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/)) vector database instance using docker 
and update the `QDRANTDB_URL` variable in the `config/.env` file:

```bash [Terminal]
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 -v ./qdrant:/qdrant/storage:z qdrant/qdrant:v1.10.1
```

:::warning
IMPORTANT: make sure you use `qdrant:v1.10.1` for compatibility with Gaianet node
:::

### Select and Setup an LLM provider

Get your Gaianet node running ([Docs](https://docs.gaianet.ai/node-guide/quick-start)) or install Ollama ([Docs](https://ollama.com/)) provider locally. 
The latter is recommended if you're looking to run the pipeline on consumer hardware.

### Load an LLM embeddings model

Load the LLM embeddings model of your preference into the LLM provider you chose in the previous step:
- You can find information on how to customize a Gaianet node [here](https://docs.gaianet.ai/node-guide/customize)
- If you chose Ollama, follow these instructions to import the LLM embeddings model:
  - Make sure the Ollama service is up and running
  - Go to the folder where the embeddings model is located. Then, create a file named `Modelfile` and paste the following (replace `<path/to/model>` 
  with your local directory, for example [Nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf](https://huggingface.co/gaianet/Nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Embedding-GGUF/tree/main?show_file_info=nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf)):

```docker [Modelfile]
FROM <path/to/model>/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
```
  - Import the model by running the following command in a terminal:
```bash [Terminal]
ollama create Nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```
  - Check the embeddings model settings by running the command:
```bash [Terminal]
ollama show Nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

## Pipeline CLI

Now you're ready to use the `rag-api-pipeline` CLI commands to execute different tasks of the RAG pipeline, from extracting data from an API source to generating vector embeddings 
and a database snapshot. If you need more details about the parameters available for each command, you can execute:

```bash [Terminal]
poetry run rag-api-pipeline <command> --help
```

### CLI available commands

Below you can find the default instructions available and an in-depth review of both the functionality and available arguments that each command offers:

```bash [Terminal]
# run the entire pipeline
poetry run rag-api-pipeline run-all API_MANIFEST_FILE --openapi-spec-file <openapi-spec-yaml-file> [--full-refresh] [--llm-provider openapi|ollama]
# or run using an already normalized dataset
poetry run rag-api-pipeline from-normalized API_MANIFEST_FILE --normalized-data-file <jsonl-file> [--llm-provider openapi|ollama]
# or run using an already chunked dataset
poetry run rag-api-pipeline from-chunked API_MANIFEST_FILE --chunked-data-file <jsonl-file> [--llm-provider openapi|ollama]
```

- **run-all**: executes the entire RAG data pipeline including API endpoint data streams, data normalization, data chunking, vector embeddings and 
database snapshot generation. You can specify the following arguments to the command:
  * `API_MANIFEST_FILE`: API pipeline manifest file (mandatory)
  * `--llm-provider [ollama|openai]`: backend embeddings model provider. default: openai-like backend (e.g. gaia rag-api-server)
  * `--api-key`: API Auth key. If not specified, it will try to get it from `config/secrets/api_key`
  * `--openapi-spec-file`: API OpenAPI YAML spec file. defaults to `config/openapi.yaml`
  * `--source-manifest-file`: Airbyte API Connector YAML manifest. If specified, it will omit the API Connector manifest generation step.
  * `--full-refresh`: clean up cache and extract API data from scratch.
  * `--normalized-only`: run pipeline until the data normalization stage.
  * `--chunked-only`: run pipeline until the data chunking stage.

- **from-normalized**: executes the RAG data pipeline using an already normalized JSONL dataset. You can specify the following arguments to the command:
  * `API_MANIFEST_FILE`: API pipeline manifest file (mandatory)
  * `--llm-provider [ollama|openai]`: backend embeddings model provider. default: openai-like backend (e.g. gaia rag-api-server)
  * `--normalized-data-file`: path to the normalized dataset in JSONL format (mandatory). Check the [Architecture](/architecture) section for details on the 
  required data schema.

- **from_chunked**: executes the RAG data pipeline using an already chunked dataset in JSONL format. You can specify the following arguments to the command:
  * `API_MANIFEST_FILE`: API pipeline manifest file (mandatory)
  * `--llm-provider [ollama|openai]`: backend embeddings model provider. default: openai-like backend (e.g. gaia rag-api-server)
  * `--chunked-data-file`: path to the chunked dataset in JSONL format (mandatory). Check the [Architecture](/architecture) section for details on the 
  required data schema.

## CLI Output

Cached API stream data and results produced from running any of the CLI commands are stored in `<OUTPUT_FOLDER>/<api_name>`. The following files and folders 
are created by the tool within this `baseDir` folder:

- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_source_generated.yaml`: generated Airbyte Stream connector manifest.
- `{baseDir}/cache/{api_name}/*`: extracted API data is cached into a local DuckDB. Database files are stored in this directory. If the `--full-refresh` argument
is specified for the `run-all` command, the cache will be cleared and API data will be extracted from scratch.
- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_stream_{x}_preprocessed.jsonl`: data streams from each API endpoint are preprocessed and stored in JSONL format
- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_normalized.jsonl`: preprocessed data streams from each API endpoint are joined together and stored in JSONL format
- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_chunked.jsonl`: normalized data that goes through the data chunking stage is then stored in JSONL format
- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_collection-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.snapshot`: vector embeddings snapshot file that was exported from Qdrant DB
- `{baseDir}/{api_name}_collection-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.snapshot.tar.gz`: compressed knowledge base that contains the vector embeddings snapshot

## Using Docker compose for Local development or in Production

TBD

- Start with building your containers: `docker compose -f local.yml build`.

- Build production containers with `docker compose -f prod.yml build`

- To run your application invoke:
    1. `docker compose -f prod.yml rm -svf`
    2. `docker compose -f prod.yml up`

## Troubleshooting

### Workaround in case of missing one of the following dependencies:

- If trying to install `pillow-heif` missing module:
  - Add the following flags `export CFLAGS="-Wno-nullability-completeness"`
- Libraries required for having libmagic working:
  - MacOS:
    - `brew install libmagic`
  - `pip install python-magic-bin`
