# RAG API Pipeline x GaiaNet node

This page contains some quick notes and instructions quick instructions on how to setup/deploy a Gaianet node and import a knowledge base snapshot.

## Selecting a knowledge base and prompts for your GaiaNet node

In order to supplement the LLM model hosted on your Gaia node with a custom knowledge base and prompts follow the instructions outlined in this [link](https://docs.gaianet.ai/node-guide/customize#select-a-knowledge-base). 
Remember to re-initialize and re-start the node after you make any configuration changes.

```bash [Terminal]
gaianet init
gaianet start
```

## Recommended GaiaNet Node Configuration

- Tested on Mac Studio 32GB RAM
- Custom prompts for the [Boardroom Aave example](/apis/boardroom-api)
