# API Examples
The repository already includes a few API pipeline manifest definitions that showcase how to use the `rag-api-pipeline` for generating knowledge bases from REST APIs. 
Each example demonstrates how to define a YAML manifest for extracting data from target API endpoints using different Authentication/Pagination strategies. 
For a more in-depth review of how to build a manifest for creating a RAG pipeline for your own API, remember to visit [Defining the API Pipeline Manifest](/manifest-definition) section.
