# API Pipeline Manifest - Overview

Under the hood, the `rag-api-pipeline` uses [Airbyteâ€™s CDK low-code framework](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/low-code-cdk-overview) 
to build source connectors for any REST APIs by generating a [declarative stream](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/yaml-overview) 
manifest in YAML format using two required spec files:

1. A well-defined [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/) for the target REST API: most API providers publishes their OpenAPI-based schema definition 
somewhere. If you cannot find it, there's a wide range of [tools](https://openapi.tools/) to generate/convert any API spec schema into the required format.
1. A source RAG API pipeline manifest

## RAG API pipeline manifest - Schema definition

You can find a manifest template in the [repo](https://github.com/raid-guild/gaianet-rag-api-pipeline/blob/main/config/api_pipeline_template.yaml). 
The API pipeline manifest MUST comply with the following schema:

### api_name

An alphanumeric-only name for the API pipeline.

### api_parameters

Contains any parameters required for building the API requests. This parameters MUST be included in the [spec](#spec) section and their values are accessible 
through the `config` object over the rest of the manifest.

### api_config

Defines the following API metadata for building requests:

- `request_method`: HTTP request method to use (e.g. "get")
- `content_type`: API support content type (e.g. "application/json")
- `response_entrypoint_field`: field that wraps data records (e.g. "data"). It can be set to an empty string if not required.

### chunking_params

A set of parameters that can be used to adjust how the `unstructured` library apply chunking to normalized data. You can find a detailed explanation of each 
parameter in this [link](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/core-functionality/chunking). Parameter default values are listed below:

- `mode`: "elements"
- `chunking_strategy`: "by_title"
- `include_orig_elements`: true
- `max_characters`: 1500
- `new_after_n_chars`: 1024
- `overlap`: 0
- `overlap_all`: false
- `combine_text_under_n_chars`: 0
- `multipage_sections`: true

### Airbyte Connector definitions

An Airbyte's declarative manifest require the following schema definitions:

#### spec ([Docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/reference#/definitions/Spec))

A source specification made up of connector metadata and how it can be configured. All parameters defined in the `api_parameters` section must be listed under 
`required` and `properties`

#### selector ([Docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/record-selector))

The record selector is responsible for translating an HTTP response into a list of Airbyte records by extracting records from the response. The API
pipeline manifest includes two base selectors that can be applied for single/multiple record responses:

```yaml
selector:
    type: RecordSelector
    extractor:
      type: DpathExtractor
      field_path: ["data"] # data field wraps multiple record data responses
selector_single:
    type: RecordSelector
    extractor:
        type: DpathExtractor
        field_path: []
```

#### requester_base ([Docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/requester)}

The Requester defines how to prepare HTTP requests to send to the source API. Here you specify the API `base_url` and the `authenticator` schema used. Airbyte supports
the most commonly used Authentication methods: `ApiKeyAuthenticator`, `BearerAuthenticator`, `BasicHttpAuthenticator` and `OAuth`. 
You can find a detailed explanation on how to configure each of them in this [link](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/authentication)

#### retriever_base ([Docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/reference#/definitions/SimpleRetriever))

A SimpleRetriever object in charge of fetching records by synchronous API requests. The retriever acts as an orchestrator between the requester, 
the record selector and the paginator. The API pipeline manifest includes a base retriever per defined selectors:

```yaml
retriever_base:
    type: SimpleRetriever
    record_selector:
      $ref: "#/definitions/selector"
retriever_single_base:
    type: SimpleRetriever
    record_selector:
      $ref: "#/definitions/selector_single"
```

#### paginator ([Docs](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/pagination))

Set the pagination strategy for API endpoints that return multiple records. Airbyte supports `Page increment`, `Offset increment` and `Cursor based` pagination strategies. 
On the other hand, the `"#/definitions/NoPagination"` is automatically set for endpoints that return a single record

### Endpoints definitions

The `endpoints` section allows you to "filter" the API endpoints from the whole list of `paths` defined in the OpenAPI spec file you want to extract data from. 
Each endpoint should be defined using the following schema:


* Endpoint path: should be used as key. It can be enclosed in double quotes to inject any of the parameters defined in `api_parameters` (.e.g. `"/example/{foo}"`):
* id: a string id to be used for the endpoint
* primary_key (Optional): field that can be used as primary key for each record
* responseSchema: response schema that will be returned by the API endpoint after applying the `selector`. Should match with the schema defined in the OpenAPI schema.
 Check the `schemas` section below for details
* textSchema: set of fields that will be parsed as texts during data chunking. Fields listed here must be defined in `responseSchema`. Check the `textSchemas` 
section below for details.

*Example*:

```yaml
"/example/{foo}"":
    id: "example"
    primary_key: "id"
    responseSchema: "#/schemas/exampleSchema"
    textSchema:
      $ref: "#/textSchemas/Example"
  /about:
    id: "about"
    primary_key: "id"
    responseSchema: "#/schemas/aboutSchema"
    textSchema:
      $ref: "#/textSchemas/About"
```

### schemas

Endpoint response schemas should be listed in this section and referenced in the endpoint's `responseSchema`. Unwrapped schemas should match the response schemas defined 
in the OpenAPI spec.

*Example*:

Endpoint response: `{data: [{id: "0", name: "foo", value: 2}, {id: "1", nane: "bar", b: 4}]}`

Endpoint schema:

```yaml
schemas:
    endpointSchema:
        type: object
            $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
            properties:
                id:
                    type: string
                name:
                    type: string
                b:
                    type: integer
```
### targetSchemas

For each endpoint, you can specify a set of fields from the schema that you want to be parsed as texts during data chunking. Make sure fields are included in the 
endpoint `responseSchema`.

*Example*:

Endpoint response: `{data: [{id: "0", name: "foo", value: 2}, {id: "1", nane: "bar", b: 4}]}`

Endpoint textSchema:

```yaml
textSchemas:
    endpointTextSchema:
        type: object
        properties:
        name:
            type: string
```
